Just an example of how to pull data using the Twitch API and Python, an update to my first project from 5 years ago which was unfortunately obsolete.
Updated to work with Python 3 and the latest Twitch API.

A simple script that looks at the current top 5 streamers in the "Oldschool Runescape" Twitch category and checks how old that account is, how many followers they've had, amount of current viewers, etc.
It then colours red and lists streamers that are in the top 5 viewers but which also have less than 100 followers and an account created less than 30 days ago (arbitrary numbers for the example)
